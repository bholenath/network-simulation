/*  Analyzing each case for the Q.1 */

Maximum Queue Size if taken as 21. 

I have taken 3 nodes at Node 1 and 4 nodes at Node 2 initially for each case.

Here queue size is considered for every frame that is at that node for that time(including the transmitting one).

Case 1 :

Transmission @: 

Node1 = 0.8 Mbps;
Node2 = 0.8 Mbps;
Node3 = 1.6 Mbps;
Node4 = 1.6 Mbps;
Node5 = 1.6 Mbps;

Propagation Distance @:

Distance13 = 20 Km.
Distance23 = 20 Km.
Distance34 = 20 Km.
Distance45 = 20 Km.
Distance54 = 20 Km.

For the case 1 we notice that the overflow occurs at the Node 2 which is due to the low bandwidth(high transmission time) at node 1 and 2, 
although nodes at 3, 4 and 5 are mostly empty as they receive less frames and due to high bandwidth(double than 1 and 2) they process them quickly.

As we can see that only 6 packets were received at Destination(Node 5) at the time of overflow.

Hence frames clog at node 1 and 2 which results into the overflow at Node 2.

Case 2 :

Transmission @: 

Node1 = 0.5 Mbps;
Node2 = 0.5 Mbps;
Node3 = 1 Mbps;
Node4 = 1 Mbps;
Node5 = 1 Mbps;

Propagation Distance @:

Distance13 = 30 Km.
Distance23 = 30 Km.
Distance34 = 30 Km.
Distance45 = 30 Km.
Distance54 = 30 Km.

For this 2 case also as we have very less bandwidth at Nodes 1 and 2 lower than Case 1 and we have increased the distance between the nodes as well which
has made the time to reach destination more slow. Hence here only 4 frames were received at the destination during overflow.

There is a large clog of frames at node 1 and 2 here as well.

Case 3 :

Transmission @: 

Node1 = 1 Mbps;
Node2 = 1 Mbps;
Node3 = 2 Mbps;
Node4 = 2 Mbps;
Node5 = 2 Mbps;

Propagation Distance @:

Distance13 = 35 Km.
Distance23 = 35 Km.
Distance34 = 35 Km.
Distance45 = 35 Km.
Distance54 = 35 Km.

Due to high transmission rate at all Nodes than previous Case here we have less clustering at nodes and during overflow we can see that the
destination node had 12 frames reached to it.


Case 4 :

Transmission @: 

Node1 = 2.5 Mbps;
Node2 = 2.5 Mbps;
Node3 = 5 Mbps;
Node4 = 5 Mbps;
Node5 = 5 Mbps;

Propagation Distance @:

Distance13 = 15 Km.
Distance23 = 15 Km.
Distance34 = 15 Km.
Distance45 = 15 Km.
Distance54 = 15 Km.

In this case as we increased the transmission rate by large amount and has also decreased the distance so the transmission of packets would be very fast
from nodes 1 and 2 to node 3  due to which we could see that node 3 would overflow as it has 2 nodes sending data to it whereas only single node to transmit
the packets which make it to clog at Node 3. 

Here we have received 21 packets before the queue overflow which is due to high transmission.
